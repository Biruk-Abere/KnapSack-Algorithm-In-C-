# KnapSack Algorithm
 - Given a set of items , each with a weight and value , determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible
- The problem often faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed size of Knapsack and must fullfill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint.
